### Description

Updated. Game--Battleship in space. A few twists on the original battleship like shields, scanning devices, cloaking. Play against another person or computer. A speed-play Salvo game option also. Built for my son, he thought it was awesome. Maybe yours would like it too. <br>

This update enables computer as opponent in all the games now. <br>

Part II has the optional WAV files (too big for one posting). Get Part II at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=40635&lngWId=1
